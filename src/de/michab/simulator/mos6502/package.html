<BODY>
In the mos6502 package all chip emulations from this hardware family are
placed.  The chip emulations placed here should not contain any system specific
functionality to keep these parts reusable when emulating different systems
based on the 6502 family of chips. When implementing a Commodore VC20 emulator
this package would house the resulting classes and possibly some of the
existing classes -- like the 6502 cpu chip emulation -- should be reusable
unmodified.<br>
The package also holds the additional classes needed to implement the real
chip. An example is the Commodore 64's video interface chip: The complexity of
this chip's inner workings was distributed across a handful of classes that all
reside in the mos6502 package with package local scope -- visible and usable
for the class implementations in that package, but not for classes in other
packages.
