				<p>The Commodore 64 was at least in Europe a phenomenon:  
				In 1982 hardly anybody knew about it and even if you read the
				right magazines, information was thin and the price was high.
				In 1983 some people bought one, including me.  I worked the
				whole summer to get the required money.  I felt a bit alone,
				since at that time I was the only one owning such a computer.
				In 1984 the picture changed and the 64 got momentum.  More and
				more people bought 64's and in 1985 nearly
				everybody had one including the pets. And &ndash; what a 
				decadence! &ndash; in '86 single
				persons started to own two, and my grandmother bought one to
				store her recipes on&hellip;</p>
				<p>This computer filled a gap and took the (male) youth by 
				storm.  Before the C64 the boys bored around with girls, motor 
				bikes, model planes and <a href="http://www.fischertechnik.de">Fischertechnik</a>.  After the infection 
				they learnt line-number-BASIC, found 6502 assembler pretty cool
				and knew that tomorrow latest they will be rich because of 
				tonight's tough hack selling millions of copies
				tomorrow&hellip;</p>

				<P>Many years later this is one of the motivations to re-create
				that computer again. Compared to today's systems it is small,
				simple and straight, but a lot of fun to work with. And it laid
				the ground for me and many others to understand today's
				technology. Well, actually the road is long and winding from the
				Commodore 64 ROM to a modern Linux or Windows system, but it was
				a starting point.</P>

				<P>From a more philosophical point of view, the work being done
				by countless hackers in the eighties should be conserved in some
				way. These guys invested part of their life time to make software
				on the Commodore 64. This investment shouldn't been thrown away
				because of advancing technology. Especially the games can be seen
				as one flavour of art and as such deserve conservation.</P>
				<P>Route 64 is a Commodore 64 emulator implemented in Java&trade;.
				When work started on Route 64 the fact that Java&trade; was the
				implementation language was interesting in itself. In the
				meantime the Java&trade; virtual machines as well as the standard
				hardware are much faster, resulting in the fact that even on
				slower systems the emulation runs at the same speed as an
				original Commodore 64. The remaining advantages of the Java&trade;
				implementation are finally that Route 64 should run on all
				systems that support a Java virtual machine, and that development
				is simpler and less error prone on Java&trade;.</P>
				<P>So let's go back in time, way back to 1983...</P>
